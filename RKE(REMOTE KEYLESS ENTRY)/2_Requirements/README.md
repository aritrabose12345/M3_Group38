# INTRODUCTION:

The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.A smart entry system is an electronic lock that controls access to a building or vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key. The term keyless entry system originally meant a lock controlled by a keypad located at or near the driver's door, which required entering a predetermined (or self-programmed) numeric code. Such systems now have a hidden touch-activated keypad.
Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.

# REQUIREMENTS:
## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

RKE transmission requires two components-

transmitter and a receiver:

Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 

Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

It shall lock the car when blue switch is ON turning ON all the LEDs.

It shall unlock the car when blue switch is pressed two times, turning off all LEDs at the same time

It shall activate or deactivate the alarm when blue switch is pressed three times, turning ON all the LEDs in a clockwise manner respectively.

It shall approach light when blue switch is pressed four times, turning ON all the LEDs in an anti-clockwise manner respectively.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## STRENGTHS:

RKE-actuated vehicle-immobilization technology minimizes car theft. 

There is no human interaction with the car as it is keyless.

Every function is managed by the buttons on the remote.

## WEAKNESS:

A remote can stop working because of dead battery & reprogramming of the remote can also be needed.

Two or more commands cannot be functioned at the same time.

## OPPORTUNITIES:

The RKE systems has a huge scope in automobiles as the RKE system can be programmed in such a way to handle/protect the automobiles from panics, like noise other than car theft by activating new features like alarms in it.

Enabling RKE systems in vehicles not only improves security of car access but also facilitates convenience to the users.

Reasonable cost.

## THREATS:

RKE system introduces many threats like key fob cloning, jamming, & so on.
